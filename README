		README OpenGL 3 Rick de Jonge & Jannick Boonstra


We split our shaders into 2 vertex shaders and 2 fragment shaders following the 
steps in the provided pdf. In the first pass we calculate the unshaded color, 
normal and depth of every pixel of the screen and stored those colors and normals
in buffers that have the size of the screen.
In the second pass we shade the colors using Phong. For this we need the original
location of each pixel, which we calculate by multiplying the location on the screen
with the inverse of our model, view and projection matrices.
