When submitting your assignment, describe (briefly) the changes you made and what difficulties you encountered in this file.

Also describe what controls (key short-cuts, mouse clicks, mouse movement etc) and possible bonus assignments you implemented, so we can check them more easily.

If you have any suggestions/feedback for improving the practical assignments or support from teaching assistants, you may include it here OR post in anonymously on Nestor under Feedback.

1 Transformations and viewing interaction

We implemented viewing the cube, rotation and scaling following the 
steps in the provided pdf. We also added a new mode (switch modes with space)
which allows for a FPS-like interaction: move the camera with w/a/s/d/q/e and 
click-and-hold the mouse to rotate the camera around the eye, opposed to rotating
the scene around the origin in the standard mode.

2 Phong shading with GLSL

The second exersize was also done following the steps in the pdf closely.
When the scene is rotated, the light moves with the objects, so you will be 
able to see the dark side of the spheres. 

When we test without using the normal matrix, the specular light doess not change
when rotating the scene, while it should. With the normal matrix included in the 
specular light of a point, the specular light changes position on the sphere.
